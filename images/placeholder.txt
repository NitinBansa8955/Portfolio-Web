IMPORTANT: Add your profile picture here!

Replace this file with your actual profile photo named "profile.jpg"

Requirements:
- Square image (e.g., 500x500px or 1000x1000px)
- Good quality headshot
- Professional appearance
- Format: JPG or PNG

The image will be displayed in the header as a circular profile picture (200x200px on desktop, 150x150px on mobile).

If you don't have a profile photo yet, you can:
1. Use a placeholder service like https://ui-avatars.com/
2. Take a professional headshot
3. Use your existing LinkedIn/GitHub profile picture

Once you have your image, save it as "profile.jpg" in this images/ folder.
