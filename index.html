        <div class="about-content">
          <p>Hello! My name is Nitin Bansal and I am on a journey to transform ideas into impactful solutions.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>I am currently a Junior Undergraduate at Indian Institute of Technology Gandhinagar, majoring in <strong>Chemical Engineering</strong> with a minor in <strong>Computer Science and Engineering</strong>.</li>
            <li>I am passionate about combining my chemical engineering background with cutting-edge <strong>Machine Learning</strong> and <strong>Full-Stack Development</strong> to solve real-world problems.</li>
            <li>My projects span <strong>3D-Bioprinting optimization</strong>, <strong>CI/CD pipelines for ML</strong>, <strong>image augmentation research</strong>, and <strong>full-stack website development</strong>.</li>
            <li>I am fascinated by automation, data-driven decision making, and building scalable web applications that make a difference.</li>
            <li>Fun fact: I love tackling complex problems, but sometimes I get too excited and start three projects at once!</li>

        <h2>My Background:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Born and raised in Bayana, Rajasthan, I've always been curious about how things work—from chemical reactions to computer algorithms.</li>
          <li>After scoring 100% in Class X, I pursued my intermediate education with a focus on PCM (Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics), preparing for the highly competitive JEE exams.</li>
          <li>Through dedication and hard work, I secured admission to IIT Gandhinagar, initially in Materials Engineering, and later successfully transitioned to Chemical Engineering after my first year through competitive branch change.</li>
          <li>My journey has been shaped by supportive mentors, challenging coursework, and hands-on projects that bridge theory with real-world applications.</li>
          <li>I've always been blessed with opportunities and unwavering support from my family. Their investment in my education drives me to give back through meaningful work.</li>
